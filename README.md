# CCompilerInCpp

I saw this project on bilibili.com and decided to follow the videos to make a C compiler in C++. The code may not be
exactly the same, but this project is someone else's idea. I start this project in my own repository just to learn from
the videos.

The uploader is called *iiicp*, and his videos about this compiler is on this
website: "https://space.bilibili.com/181099947/channel/seriesdetail?sid=1964966&ctype=0".

# Features

This C compiler only works on Linux.
