# CCompilerInCpp

I saw this project on bilibili.com and decided to follow the videos to make a C compiler in C++. The code may not be
exactly the same but still not my idea. I start this project in my own repository just to learn from
the videos.

The author is called *iiicp*, and his videos about this compiler is on this
website: [开发C编译器]("https://space.bilibili.com/181099947/channel/seriesdetail?sid=1964966&ctype=0"). His project can be found here: "https://github.com/iiicp/ccc".

# Features

This C compiler works on both Linux and MacOS.

# More

A test framework called *Catch2* is used in this project. *Catch2* can be found at "https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2".
